The original parrot gif source is Geiger Powell, as posted by [Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/party-parrot-creator/).  Powell has given permission for unlimited use and adaptation of the gif.

The original gif was strictly green, so we still do not know where the party colored version originated. If you have information about how that came to be, we would love to know more.
